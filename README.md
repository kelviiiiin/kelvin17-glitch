## About Me

Hi! My name is Kelvin Mwendwa. I am a CS student as of now. I have an enduring urge for continuous learning and constant improvement. My degree has so far introduced me
to the world of CyberSec. I am especially fascinated in the subfields OffSec and Read Teaming. I am currently learning and horning my skills. I also try to hack systems for fun; ethically, ofcourse :).
